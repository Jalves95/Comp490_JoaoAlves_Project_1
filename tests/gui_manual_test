The idea of testing GUI is important since no one can tell what the user will see when the GUI loads.
Everyone today has different operating systems that require different code to run. Someone using a MAC may
have different outputs with someone running Linux. Testing GUI should continue, as no one wants any
implications with customers seeing different output. For example, I remember when the Play Station 3 and
X Box 360 came out. People were playing the same game, but some had more bugs than other. Perhaps, it
was due to the lack of tests back in the day. Even though they were playing the same game, different bugs
occurred. Testing GUI will help the developer understand the program, this leads to the developer
understanding how each element in the GUI works. Which increased the reliability of their product.
